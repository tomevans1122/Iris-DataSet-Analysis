# Iris-DataSet-Analysis

This repository investigates the iris dataset. This dataset contains information on three different classes of flowers. It has been used extensively in machine learning so I thought it a good dataset to conduct analysis of machine learning models on. Here is a snippet of what the dataset looks like: 
| Sepal-length | sepal-width | petal-length | petal-width | class |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|-------|
|  5.1 | 3.5 | 1.4 | 0.2 | iris-setosa |
